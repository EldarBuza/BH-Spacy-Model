config.cfg is a config file you automatically generate through SpaCy and it is absolutely NECESSARY in order for any model to be trained.
It is basically a guideline on what the pipeline will contain and what the training process will look like. It is used to define the number of 
epochs, batch size and sheer goals for the model.
